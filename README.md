# TechLabs- Weekdays

# Problem statement

In 2019, French journalist Judith Duportail published a researcher paper about Tinder’s algorithm. 
It revealed that the company uses the “Elo system” a rating method that give positive or negative points depending if other users are swiping right or left on your profile. 
In addition, the algorithm has multiple bias coded. Indeed, women who are younger would get extra points but would lose points if they are highly educated. While men have more points when they are older and educated. 
The algorithm purposely reproduces patriarchal behaviours even though Tinder has declared it is not using this system anymore.

Most of the meeting apps rely on a swipe method which does not give room for fair meeting but rather favor a specific profile that is seen as dominant in our society. 
Hence users are not matching together per se but rather matching against each other. By 2040, sociologists predict that 80% of couples will have meet on dating apps. 
Therefore, it is important to hold creators of those app accountable of the bias coded in the app.

# Solution: key points

- Weekdays is a meeting app that give you the opportunity to meet new people without the pressure of a date
- Each user has to be verified (i.e. phone and ID submission), pick different tags to register its interests, and tell us if they are open to date or not
- Every day of the week, Weekdays will select a new user for you, with whom you are likely to share similar interests
- In order to first interact with your new match, you need to pick a 5 minutes time slot of the day itself to enter a video call
- If you both have a great conversation, Weekdays will unlock the chat for you to continue talking

# Impact on sustainability

Gender equality, as one of the Sustainable Development Goals proposed by the United Nations, is the key aspect underlying the idea of Weekdays. 
By using the app, individuals will be matched with one person a day which will provide them with the time to get to know each other based on interests and sympathy.
Users are considered as human beings rather than commodities thanks to a slow-paced design that dismisses the swipe method and remove the pressure of a romantic date.
Hence, Weekdays allows users to have balanced interactions with each other thanks to an algorithm that only relies on distance, the age range entered by the users, and the interests selected.
